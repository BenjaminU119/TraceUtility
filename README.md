# TraceUtility

A proof of concept on how to parse .trace documents generated by Instruments, using the undocumented frameworks shipped with Instruments.

We need to link against these frameworks

* `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTFoundation.framework`
* `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTInstrumentsFoundation.framework`
* `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/Frameworks/InstrumentsPlugIn.framework`

Instrument templates used by the app are plugins in `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/PlugIns`

Such as `SamplerPlugin.xrplugin` for Time Profiler.

The code is short and commented out and I don't need to explain much here.
