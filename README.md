# TraceUtility

A proof of concept on how to parse .trace documents generated by Instruments, using the undocumented frameworks shipped with Instruments.

We need to link against these frameworks:

* `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTFoundation.framework`
* `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTInstrumentsFoundation.framework`
* `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/Frameworks/InstrumentsPlugIn.framework`
* `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/Frameworks/InstrumentsKit.framework`

Instrument templates used by the app are packages in `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/Packages` and plugins in `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/PlugIns`.

It seems Apple is migrating from `PlugIns` to `Packages`. For example, the instrument `Time Profile` in `PlugIns/SamplerPlugin.xrplugin` is deprecated in Xcode 8 and there is a new version in `Packages/Sampling.instrdst`.

The code is commented out and I don't need to explain much here.
